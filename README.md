# movies-with-pandas
Hi friends! So I've been loving Pandas. Pandas is a library in the Python language. It allows you to read in your data and view/modify it. It's most robust feature is the Data Frame which is similar to an Excel spreadsheet. It puts your data into a nice readable table and makes querying easy.

You can find a tiny tutorial on my website at http://kevinwong.io/Exploring-Movie-Data-With-Pandas/ where I look at movie data. A lot of my inspiration came from Greg Reda's blog post on pandas and Tom Augspurger's Pydata tutorial of pandas. I'm still learning a lot about Pandas and have incorporated it into my personal arsenal.
